# Meth sync backend

This uses [express-pouchdb]() to expose a sync endpoint for PouchDB.

In _dev_ (default) mode the process uses an in-memory PouchDB. In _production_
mode it uses the externally hosted production CouchDB instance.

##Â Development

Deploy to https://zeit.co/now and note the deployed endpoint:

```shell
$ yarn deploy:dev
```

 Enter this into
your [meth-browser]() `appConfig.json`.

## Production

Deploy to https://sync.meth-browser.com
